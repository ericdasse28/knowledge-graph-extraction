# Knowledge Graph extraction from text
Explain what a knowledge graph is here.

In this project, I implement a solution to extract a knowledge graph from text. As opposed to many
existing solutions already in existence, I challenged myself to do so using Software Craftship best
practices such as clean code, TDD and refactoring so that the code is easily readable and understandable.

I hope this code will be a joy for any reader to go through :)
